Given N points on the plane. Find the (N-1)-components not self-intersecting open polygonal curve, passing through all these points.

Construct the polygonal curve in the order of increasing x-coordinate. If there are two points with the same x-coordinate, position earlier that point, which has the smaller y-coordinate.

Use heapsort to sort the points.

Sample Input:

4
0 0
1 1
1 0
0 1

Sample Output:

0 0
0 1
1 0
